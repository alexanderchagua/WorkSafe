My favorite quote by Alexander chagua

President Russell M. Nelson - “Peacemakers Needed” (April 2023)
“As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are to be examples of how to interact with others - especially when we have differences of opinion. One of the easiest ways to identify a true follower of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people.”


My favourite quote by Gianfranco Gosdinski
"Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved."
— Thomas S. Monson, "Finding Joy in the Journey," October 2008 General Conference
