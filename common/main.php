    <h2>Occupational Safety and Health: A Fundamental Right</h2>
    <p>
      Ensuring a safe and healthy working environment is a fundamental principle and right at work. Every worker has the right to return home safe and sound at the end of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite progress, millions of workers still face unacceptable risks. WorkSafe supports organizations in building a culture of prevention and compliance with international standards.
